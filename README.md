2. Install Django using the following command:
>`pip install django`
   
### Installation

   >`git clone https://github.com/codewithbilly/crud.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   >`cd crud`
3. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   >`python -m venv venv`
4. On Windows:
   >`venv\Scripts\activate`
5. On macOS and Linux:

6. Install project dependencies:
   >`pip install -r requirements.txt`
7. Apply migrations to set up the database:
   >`python manage.py migrate`
8. Create a superuser to access the Django admin panel:
   >`python manage.py createsuperuser`
### Usage
